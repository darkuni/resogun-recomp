# RESOGUN notes

Findings from the first look at the game files. Target build: **CUSA00038 01.10**.

## The dump

- Content ID `UP9000-CUSA00038_00-RESOGUN000000002`.
- Base game 01.00 (446 MB PKG) plus the 01.10 update (642 MB PKG). Both are fake PKGs: the
  EKPFS decrypts with the public fake keys, so `scripts/pkg_extract.py` unpacks them.
- 01.10 changelog (Sony): PS4 Pro support, 4K on Pro, HDR, visual improvements.

Files in the 01.10 update:

| File | Size | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `eboot.bin` | 17.4 MB | fSELF, plaintext segments. ELF type `0xFE10` (SCE dynamic executable), entry `0x36cbe0` |
| `sce_module/libc.prx` | 1.06 MB | The game's own libc (linked by `link_libc.py`) |
| `sce_module/libSceFios2.prx` | 451 KB | The game's own Fios2 (linked by `link_modules.py`) |
| `audio.pck` | 287 MB | Wwise file package (`AKPK`) |
| `stream.dat` | 353 MB | Housemarque data archive (`TSFM` magic), not documented yet |
| `sce_discmap.plt`, `sce_discmap_patch.plt` | | Disc maps |
| `video/title.mp4`, `video/menu.mp4` | | Intro and menu videos (base game only) |

The update replaces `eboot.bin`, both PRX files, `audio.pck` and `stream.dat`; the videos come
from the base game, so the game folder is the base game with the update copied over it.

## The executable

- Engine: Housemarque **Sasquatch**. The build path in the asserts is
  `D:\jenkins\workspace\RESOGUN eX PS4\resogun_EX\...`; the render backend lives in
  `Libs\Sasquatch\Impl\Render\Lowlevel\Orbis\`.
- Segments: code `0x0`-`0xc42604` (R E), relro `0xc44000`, data `0xd08000` (filesz `0x1c4ec8`,
  memsz `0x89f0e0`), TLS 0x10 bytes, `.eh_frame_hdr` at `0xbf3710`.
- 74,512 RELA relocations, 734 PLT relocations, 751 imported symbols.
- Audio is Wwise on `libSceAudio3d` + `libSceAudioOut`, the same pairing as WipEout.

## Import check (first build)

Built on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04, `GOW3_LTO=OFF bash build.sh`) and run with
`run.py --check-imports` on 01.00 + 01.10. Preparation works unchanged: the game's own libc and
Fios2 link at `0x15b0000` / `0x16b0000` (203 native bindings, `fs`->`gs` patched 10 times),
leaving 644 imports to the host runtime. **105 of them were missing** (filled in below).

AvPlayer (the intro videos) is covered by shadPS4's library in the video core; Move and Camera
answer "not connected" (`src/runtime_extra.c`). Gnm, VideoOut, AudioOut, Audio3d, Pad, SaveData
and the rest of libkernel are covered.

Missing at the first check, by library (names from `tools/aerolib.inl`):

**Needed for the game to run**

- libSceFiber (6): `_sceFiberInitializeImpl`, `sceFiberFinalize`, `sceFiberGetSelf`,
  `sceFiberReturnToThread`, `sceFiberRun`, `sceFiberSwitch`. No implementation in the runtime
  yet; needs real context switching.
- libSceJson2 (13): `sce::Json::Value::set` (ValueType, String, bool, double, long, unsigned
  long), `Value::count`, `Value::toString`, `Value::operator bool`, `Value::operator[](unsigned
  long)`, `String::at`, `String::length`, `String::operator==(const char*)`. Extends
  `src/runtime_json.c`.
- libkernel (3): `sceKernelSleep`, `scePthreadGetthreadid`, `scePthreadSetschedparam`.
- libSceRtc (3): `sceRtcParseDateTime`, `sceRtcTickAddHours`, `sceRtcTickAddSeconds`.
- libSceAppContent (2): `sceAppContentGetAddcontInfo`, `sceAppContentTemporaryDataMount2`.
- libScePad (1): `scePadSetMotionSensorState`.
- libSceUserService (1): `sceUserServiceGetUserColor`.
- libSceSystemService (1): `sceSystemServiceReenableMusicPlayer`.

**Stub as unavailable (PS VR, PSN, companion app, dialogs)**

- libSceVrTracker (11) and libSceHmd (4): PS VR. Report no headset.
- libSceCompanionHttpd (10): the second-screen companion app server.
- libSceNpScore (8) and libSceNpTus (10): leaderboards and title user storage.
- libSceNpManager (4), libSceNpUtility (3, word filter), libSceNpMatching2 (1),
  libSceNpCommerce (1), libSceNpFriendListDialog (6), libSceInvitationDialog (1),
  libSceWebBrowserDialog (5), libSceErrorDialog (1).
- libSceIme (3), libSceImeDialog (1): on-screen keyboard.
- libSceHttp (2), libSceNet (1), libSceScreenShot (3).

## Imports filled in, first boot

All 105 are now answered (`run.py --check-imports`: 0 missing):

- `scripts/gen_import_names.py` added 141 RESOGUN names to `src/import_names.inc`; 15 of the
  105 were functions the runtime already had but could not reach without their NID.
- `src/runtime_fiber.c` (new): libSceFiber with its own context switch (rbp, rbx, r12-r15,
  MXCSR, x87 control word), a host-allocated stack per fiber (the game's context buffer is
  recorded, not used, as shadPS4 does on Windows), the TEB stack bounds following each switch on
  Windows, and a fiber's new state published only after its stack is saved, so another thread
  cannot resume it mid-switch. `tests/test_fiber.c` covers run, switch, return to the thread, an
  entry that returns, resuming on another thread, the error results and the FPU state.
- `src/runtime_json.c`: the six `Value::set` overloads, `Value::toString`, `Value::operator bool`
  (the value exists), `String::at`, `String::length`.
- `src/runtime_rtc.c`: `sceRtcTickAddHours`, `sceRtcTickAddSeconds`, `sceRtcParseDateTime`
  (RFC 3339, RFC 2822 and asctime, with zone offsets and fractions of a second).
- `src/runtime_kernel.c`, `src/runtime_thread.c`: `sceKernelSleep`, `scePthreadSetschedparam`
  (recorded like the priority).
- `src/runtime_services.c`, `src/runtime_extra.c`: the offline answers. Score and TUS requests
  start and finish signed out; PS VR tracking initializes and reports no headset (error codes and
  memory sizes from shadPS4); the companion app server never gets a request; dialogs report
  unavailable; the hardware keyboard opens and never sends a key; no add-ons are entitled.

First boot (Linux, Xvfb, Mesa lavapipe software Vulkan on 2 cores): the game runs, starts 32
threads, opens 3 audio ports and streams from `stream.dat`/`audio.pck`, and draws its boot
screens ("Sony Interactive Entertainment presents", then the XDEV logo) through the shadPS4 video
core. No runtime errors in the log; the only warnings are Vulkan features lavapipe lacks.
Software rendering is far too slow to judge speed; that needs a real GPU.

`build.sh --test` on Linux: `pad-test` needed `-lm` (added). `runtime-test` and `sema-test` do
not link (undefined `runtime_image_base`, `runtime_wipeout_paused`); that is unchanged from
wipeout_pc. Every other test passes.

## shadPS4 reports for this game

- Linux, shadPS4 0.12.5, 01.10: playable, no graphics or speed issues, ship editor works
  ([#1934](https://github.com/shadps4-compatibility/shadps4-game-compatibility/issues/1934)).
- Windows, up to shadPS4 0.21.0: crashes after the splash screen with the SDL audio backend;
  reported working with OpenAL. The log shows a dummy `sceSysmoduleLoadModule` for
  `ORBIS_SYSMODULE_AV_PLAYER`
  ([#413](https://github.com/shadps4-compatibility/shadps4-game-compatibility/issues/413)).

So the shadPS4 video core already draws this game; the work here is the runtime side.

## Intro video crash (AvPlayer)

About 13 minutes into the software-rendered boot, right after it loads libSceAvPlayer (system
module 0xa5) for the intro video, the game ended with `std::system_error: Resource deadlock
avoided`. Under gdb (`catch throw system_error`) the throw is on shadPS4's AvPlayer controller
thread:

    std::shared_mutex::lock_shared            <- EDEADLK: this thread holds it exclusively
    AvPlayerState::GetStreamCount             avplayer_state.cpp
    AvPlayer::GetStreamCount                  avplayer_impl.cpp
    <RESOGUN's AvPlayer event callback>       guest code

RESOGUN starts playback from its event callback (on StateReady, so on the controller thread).
`AvPlayerState::Start()` held `m_source_mutex` exclusively while it sent StatePlay, the game's
callback asked for the stream count, and the second lock on the same thread threw. `Stop()`,
`Pause()` and `Resume()` had the same shape with a shared lock (a callback that starts playback
from one of those events would throw the same way). All four now release the lock before the event
goes to the game, as `UpdateEndOfFileState()` already did. Upstream shadPS4 still has the same
`Start()`. The Windows compatibility report for this game crashes at the same point (after the
splash screen, AvPlayer loaded); whether this is that crash is untested.

With the fix the intro video plays and the game reaches its title screen ("Press ✕ to start")
with no errors, still on lavapipe (about 15 minutes of software rendering to get there).


## First Windows test (RTX 4070 Ti)

On Shane's PC the game passed the title screen and started loading the game itself (data
workers, task threads, about 320 pipelines compiled), then faulted inside NVIDIA's driver:
`read access to 0000000000000130 at nvoglv64.dll+0xe3b270`, exit 3. The stack pointer was about
1.7 KB below its stack's top, so the faulting thread had only just started: by all signs one of
the driver's own worker threads, not a call from the game or the port. The crash report could not
say more: the driver keeps no frame pointers and its unwind found nothing.

The crash report now also prints the faulting thread's name and start address, the fiber running
on it if any, and a scan of its stack for return addresses (values just after a call instruction
in a loaded module or the game); the log names the Vulkan driver and its version at every start.

## One program instead of the launcher

The Python launcher, its scripts and the WipEout packaging are replaced, for players, by the
loader itself: `resogun.exe` / `resogun` started without arguments (src/bootstrap.c) finds the
PKGs or a `game` folder beside it, unpacks the PKGs (src/boot_pkg.c, src/boot_crypto.c) and
prepares the game (src/boot_prepare.c) on the first start, then sets what run.py used to set
(resogun.ini, user/, restart command) and starts.

Checked against the Python scripts on the RESOGUN dump:

- PKG unpack of 01.00 + 01.10: the same 36 files, byte for byte (9 s + 14 s).
- Preparation: `boot-linked.bin`, `functions.bin` and `content.bin` byte-identical to
  `prepare.py` + `link_modules.py` + `function_starts.py` + `content_profile.py` (0.1 s).
- First start, second start (10 ms, nothing redone), only an update PKG, nothing beside the
  program: each shows the right result or message.
